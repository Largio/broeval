BROEVAL

BROEVAL is the continuation of the "broeval"-Project for a master thesis at the university of Heidelberg.
The "broeval"-Project was created by Jan Pawellek and can be viewed in this git repository:

In the process of creating another master thesis, this project is continued by Lars Wiete.
The LICENSE file was updated with this second name.

BROEVAL is a testbed for the Intrusion Destection Systems "Bro" and "Snort". It is created as the byproduct of two master theses written at the Institute for Informatik at the University of Heidelberg.
