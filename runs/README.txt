Folder structure is crucial !
For every further IDS that is added to this testbed, you need a corresponding folder, because the information which IDS is to be used is internally retrieved by this mandatory foldername. In this case: "bro" and "snort"
The folder-name/IDS-name cannot include the "/"-character and the " "-character (space) /because those are used as marking characters within regex)
